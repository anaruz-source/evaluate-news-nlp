> ## Overview 

NLPs leverage the machine leaning and deep learning to interpret the human speech. A definition by weekpedia:
> **Natural language processing** (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

In this project, we make use of [Meaning Cloud](www.meaningcloud.com) Text Analytics â€“ MeaningCloud text mining solutions, mainly its **sentiment analysis API**, free trial limited to 20,000 credits.
The goal of this project is to give you practice with:

- Setting up Webpack
- Sass styles 
- Webpack Loaders and Plugins
- Creating layouts and page design ( bootstrap design system used)
- Service workers
- Using APIs and creating requests to external urls, urls validation performed with **_extractHostPath_** function using a **Regex** in /src/client/js folder

> ## Deploying

visit link below:

[NLP APP](https://nlp-udacity-nd.herokuapp.com/)

A great step to take with your finished project would be to deploy it! Unfortunately its a bit out of scope for me to explain too much about how to do that here, but checkout [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for some really intuitive free hosting options.
